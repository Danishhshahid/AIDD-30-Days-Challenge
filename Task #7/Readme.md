**SPECKit Plus**

**What is SPECKit Plus?**  
SPECKit Plus is a clear, structured framework designed to simplify any project by breaking it down into logical, easy-to-manage phases. It guides you from understanding the project’s purpose all the way through planning, task creation, and successful execution.

**Core Components of SPECKit Plus**  
The framework consists of five key stages, each with a specific focus:

**/constitution – Project Foundation & Purpose**  
The Constitution establishes the “why” behind the project. It clearly defines what the project is, the problem it solves, and its core objectives—creating a solid foundation before any work begins.

**/specify – Requirements & Specifications**  
This step captures all detailed requirements: features, functionality, inputs, outputs, rules, constraints, and technical specifications. It ensures everyone knows exactly what must be built.

**/plan – Strategy & Roadmap**  
The Plan outlines how the project will be accomplished. It includes the overall strategy, timeline, required tools, dependencies, milestones, and a complete execution roadmap.

**/tasks – Task Breakdown & Assignment**  
Here the project is divided into small, actionable tasks with clear owners, deadlines, and priorities. This keeps work organized and makes progress easy to track.

**/implement – Development & Delivery**  
The final stage is where everything comes together. Tasks are executed, features are built, tested, and integrated until the complete solution is delivered.
